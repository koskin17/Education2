List anf filter file content
Usually the filters are based on

Line Numbers
Row Filters
Column Filters
The cat command

The cat command is a utility command in Linux. One of its most common usages is to print the content of a file onto the standard output stream. Other than that, the cat command also allows us to write some texts into a file.

Syntax: cat

cat /etc/passwd
It shows the content of the file

cat -n /etc/passwd
Head command To filter the output based on line numbers and that to be from starting of the file then we use head command.

Syntax: head

By default head command gives you top 10 lines of the file but you can change it according to your needs.

head /etc/passwd
head -n 5 /etc/passwd
It gives the first 5 lines of the file

Tail Command

Head command gives you the top lines of the file however if you want to print the last lines you can use tail command

Syntax: tail

tail command will print last 10 lines and however you can change them using -n option.

tail /etc/passwd
tail -n 5 /etc/passwd
It gives the last 5 lines of the file

Grep command

The grep filter searches a file for a particular pattern of characters, and displays all lines that contain that pattern. The pattern that is searched in the file is referred to as the regular expression (grep stands for globally search for regular expression and print out).

Syntax: grep

grep root /etc/passwd
It fetches all the lines which have the word root in them.

Awk Command In some cases the content needs to be filtered based on the columns in that case we use awk command.

Syntax: awk -F 'delimiter' '{print $column-number}'

awk -F : '{print $1}' /etc/passwd
It will print the first column of the file

awk -F : '{print $1,$2}' /etc/passwd
It will print the first and second column of the file
