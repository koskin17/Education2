Step 1
Installation
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime for server-side programming. It allows developers to create scalable backend functionality using JavaScript, a language many are already familiar with from browser-based web development.

In this guide, we will show you three different ways of getting Node.js installed on an Ubuntu 20.xx | 22..xx | 23.xx server:

using apt with an alternate PPA software repository to install specific versions of the nodejs package
installing nvm , the Node Version Manager, and using it to install and manage multiple versions of Node.js (Recommended)
using apt to install the nodejs package from Ubuntu’s default software repository.(Not recommended because it installs older versions.)
For many users, using apt with the default repo will be sufficient.

Installing in a Linux Ubuntu .
Method 1
The NodeSource repository (https://github.com/nodesource/distributions) provides the latest Node.js packages for Ubuntu. This NodeSource repository for Node.js 18 LTS can be added to the system using the command:

curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | sudo -E bash - &&\
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

Method 2 – Install Node.js 18.xx LTS on Ubuntu 23.xx|22.xx|20.xx by using NVM
NVM(Node Version Manager) allows one to install a specific version of Node.js. First, you need to have NVM installed on your system before you proceed. Install NVM

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/master/install.sh &&\
bash install.sh &&\
source ~/.bashrc

Verify the NVM installation.

nvm -v
Once installed, use NVM to install the desired Node.js version. Populate a list of available versions with the command:

nvm list-remote
Now go ahead and install the latest available version of Node.js 20

 nvm install v20
Once complete, verify the installation.

node -v
With NVM, you can also list the installed Node.js versions with the command:

nvm ls
Now go ahead and install the latest stable version of Node.js 18

 nvm install v18
List the installed Node.js versions with the command:

nvm ls
Now we have 2 versions installed, the latest installed 18 is active. Switch to a preferred version of Node.js (for example 20 version ).

nvm use 20
Once complete, verify the version.

node -v
