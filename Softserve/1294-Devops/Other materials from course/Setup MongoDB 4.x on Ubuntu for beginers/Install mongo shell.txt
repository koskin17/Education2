If you will to remote connect to database, please make next steps:

Connection refused means you probably do not have a firewall problem. Connection timeout indicates a firewall issue.
Since you can connect locally via localhost, the error indicates that the mongo process is only listening on localhost.
Edit the file /etc/mongod.conf. The interesting line is bindIp.
It should look like this for IPv4 only: bindIp: 0.0.0.0
If you have IPv6 enabled bindIp: ::,0.0.0.0 *Warning: enable authentication first. You might be hacked faster than you might expect.
