Your laboratories
Python 3 is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more effectively.

In this labs, we use Python 3 installed on an Ubuntu 2x.xx server.

To verify whether pip is already installed for your preferred Python:

python3 -m pip -V
If all is well, you should see something like the following:

python3 -m pip -V pip 21.0.1 from /usr/lib/python3.9/site-packages/pip (python 3.9)

If so, pip is available, and you can move on to the next step. If you see an error like No module named pip, youâ€™ll need to install pip under your chosen Python interpreter before proceeding. This may mean installing an additional OS package (for example, python3-pip), or installing the latest pip directly from the Python Packaging Authority by running the following:

curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
python3 get-pip.py --user
Clone from github, install and run python server . Clone from github, install and run frontend. If you run a node.js frontend, please, update url address in .env to ACCESS WEB APP.
