Installing MariaDB
Now you need to install the database system to be able to store and manage data. MariaDB is a popular database management system, a clone to MySQL and absolutely free. The command system is identical to MySQL. Note: Do not install MySQL and MariaDB together, as this may cause a conflict. More details MariaDB

Consider the installation option under Ubuntu Linux.

Again, use apt to acquire and install this software:

sudo apt install mariadb-server -y
sudo mysql_secure_installation
This will take you through a series of prompts where you can make some changes to your MariaDB installation’s security options. The first prompt will ask you to enter the current database root password. Since you have not set one up yet, press ENTER to indicate “none”. You’ll be asked if you want to switch to unix socket authentication. Since you already have a protected root account, you can skip this step. Type n and then press ENTER. The next prompt asks you whether you’d like to set up a database root password. On Ubuntu, the root account for MariaDB is tied closely to automated system maintenance, so you should not change the configured authentication methods for that account. Doing so would make it possible for a package update to break the database system by removing access to the administrative account. Type n and then press ENTER.

sudo systemctl status mariadb
First, open up the MariaDB prompt:

sudo mariadb
Create a user:

GRANT ALL ON *.* TO 'admin'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password' WITH GRANT OPTION;
Create a remote user:

GRANT ALL ON *.* TO 'ruser'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password' WITH GRANT OPTION;
Update database privileges:

FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
Exit from MariaDB CLI

exit
When the firewall is enabled, add rules to open port 3306 and restart the firewall.

sudo ufw allow 3306 & ufw reload
After setup you have login and create new database in to MariaDB server by use created users for example:

mariadb -u ruser -p
CREATE DATABASE softserve;
Show created databases:

SHOW DATABASES;
Use the created database:

USE softserve;
Create a new table in to current database:

CREATE TABLE products ( id INT(5) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, name VARCHAR(191) NULL DEFAULT NULL, price DECIMAL (18, 2) NULL DEFAULT NULL ,level TINYINT(2) NULL DEFAULT NULL, PRIMARY KEY (id)) ENGINE=InnoDB  DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4;

Insert new data in to created table:

INSERT INTO products (name, price, level)  
VALUES ('Salt', '19', '2'),  
('Sugar', '32', '3'),  
('Bread', '17', '0'),
('Butter', '55', '1'),  
('Milk', '32', '2');
Test correct inserting data:

SELECT * FROM products ORDER BY name ASC;
Get out of MariaDB:

exit
