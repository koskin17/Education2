Pipes
Pipes are used to send the output of one command to another command without storing the content anywhere physically on disk.

Syntax : com1 | com2

cat /etc/passwd | grep root
Note: All the commands will not accept inputs over pipes. In case if we need to take the input then we take the help of xargs command.

touch sample.txt
ls
echo sample.txt | rm -f
ls
Now you can use the xargs command.

echo sample.txt | xargs rm -f
ls
