SonarQube Fundamentals

SonarQube Basics

SonarQube is an open-source tool for code quality analysis. It can scan source code for potential bugs and vulnerabilities and generates a report which allows you to identify issues. It scans up to 30 programming languages.

SonarQube has two parts: a scanner application on the local machine to scan the code and a server application for keeping records.

This guide explains how you can install and use SonarQube on a Ubuntu 22.04 server.
