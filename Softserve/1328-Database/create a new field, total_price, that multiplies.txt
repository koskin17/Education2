In the order_details table, we have the fields unit_price and quantity.
For the orders with order_id in range 10250 ..10259 create a new field, total_price, that multiplies unit_price and quantity together. We’ll ignore the discount field for now.
In addition, show the order_id, product_id, unit_price, and quantity. Order by order_id and product_id.

SELECT order_id, product_id, unit_price, quantity, 
       unit_price * quantity AS total_price
FROM order_details
WHERE order_id BETWEEN 10250 AND 10259
ORDER BY order_id, product_id;

Given customers table

How many customers do we have in Germany? The result set should contain only one value with the alias number_of_german_customers.
Note. In order to get the total number of customers in Germany, we need to use what’s called an aggregate function.

SELECT COUNT(*) AS number_of_german_customers
FROM customers
WHERE country = 'Germany';
